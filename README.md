## Question 1: Monte Carlo Method for One-Factor Option Pricing
- Final project for IB9JH0 2019-2020 C++ for Quantitative Finance - Warwick Business School
- Object oriented approach to using Monte Carlo methods (Euler's method and exact simulation) to price European, arithmetic Asian and geometric Asian call and put options
- The time and error measurements of each method (and each option type) was measured and compared using standard numerical analysis and computational complexity theory
- The code uses boost 1_72_0 and Numpy and MatPlotLib in Python
-- The Python code should execute smoothly if .py files are automatically opened with python.exe in the user's computer
